//  Keeps track of the commands in a playground including their location in the code view and whether they need to be
//  evaluated.
//
//  A command must start with a line that has no white space in the first column and extends over all immediately
//  following lines whose first character is a whitespace. A command may include trailing empty (only whitespace) lines
//  and may have empty lines interspersed with code lines. This emulates Haskell's off-side rule.
//
//  Commands are evaluated asynchronously. To ensure the consistency of the playground commands data structures and 
//  access to it, all *reading and writing* to playground commands must be performed on the main thread.
