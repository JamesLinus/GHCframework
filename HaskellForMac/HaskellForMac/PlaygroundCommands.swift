//  Keeps track of the commands in a playground including their location in the code view and whether they need to be
//  evaluated.
//
//  A command must start with a line that has no white space in the first column and extends up to the next line
//  that has no white space in the first column. A command may include trailing empty (only whitespace) lines and may
//  have empty lines interspersed with code lines.
